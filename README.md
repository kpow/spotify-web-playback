# Spotify Web Playback SDK (ES6 async-await) Template

The Web Playback SDK is client-side JavaScript library which allows you to create a new player in Spotify Connect and play any audio track from Spotify in the browser. You can read the documentation [here](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).

This template uses the Implicit Grant authorization flow, which is carried out client-side and does not involve secret keys. The access tokens that are issued are short-lived and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.

This template uses the [new async-await syntax in ES6](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await). Want to use the non-async-await version? [Click here](https://spotify-web-playback.glitch.me).

Read about all Spotify authorization flows in the [Authorization Guide](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/).
